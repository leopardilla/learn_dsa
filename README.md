## Binary search

##  Analyze the speed of an algorithm (Big O notation)

## Recursion

## Quicksort

## Greedy algorithm

## Graph algorithms: breadth-first search, Dijkstra’s algorithm 
Breadth-first search and Dijkstra’s algorithm are ways to find the shortest distance between two points in a network: you can use this approach to calculate the degrees of separation between two people or the shortest route to a destination.

## Machine-learning algorithm: K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
You can use KNN to build a recommendations system, an OCR engine, a system to predict stock values—anything that involves predicting a value (“We think Adit will rate this movie 4 stars”) or classifying an object (“That letter is a Q”)
