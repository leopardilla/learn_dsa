learn DSA in public

# Basic definitions:
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Big-O Notation 
- Recursion

# Basic Data Structures
## Linear DS 
### 1.1. Static: 
- Array/List 
### 1.2. Dinamic: 
- Stack 
- Queue (Deque, Circular Queue, Priority Queue)
- Linked list
- Progress

# Non-Linear DS 
## 2.1. Tree
### 2.1.1. Binary tree 
- Full Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Tree
- Balanced Binary Tree
## 2.2. Graph
## Heap
## Hash table
## Matrix
 
## Operations in data structures:
- traversing - visiting each element of the DS only once
- sorting - sorting the elements in the DS in ascending (from low to high) and descending (from high to low) order
- deleting - removing an element from a DS
- merging - the storage of elements located in two different data files by combining them into one data file
- inserting - adding elements of the same type in a DS
- searching - finding an element in a DS that satisfies one or more conditions

# Basic Algorithms
## Basic Search and Sort algorithms:
### Search 
- Linear Search 
- Binary Search 
- Search an element in a sorted and rotated array

### Sort 
- Quick Sort 
- Bubble Sort 
- Selection Sort 
- Insertion Sort 
- Merge Sort 
- Heap Sort (Binary Heap) 
- Topological Sort 
- Etc. (Bucket Sort, Radix Sort, Tim Sort, Shell Sort, Counting sort)

### String Search algorithms: 
- string reverse 
- palindrome sub-string 
- prefix 
- suffix 
- border anagram searching for pattern 
- naive "compare each char of pattern (P) to each char of text (T)"

## Divide and Conquer 
## Dynamic Pogramming
